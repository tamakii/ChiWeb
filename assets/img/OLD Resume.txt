I have a Bachelor of Visual Arts degree. During my studies, I have also studied courses to become a designer and computer graphics, illustration, traditional painting art, history of art courses to satisfy my curiosity on other cultures.

I have over nine years of professional experience in graphic design and product design. I'm interested in all kinds of visual design, but my major focus is on designing flat image, packaging design and product design. I also have skills in other fields like branding, icon design and popular accessories design.
